/**
 * @file z_viszbuf.c
 *
 * This file implements a full-screen framebuffer effect for visualizing the z-buffer (AKA depth buffer), using either
 * cycling RGBA or a single fading color.
 *
 * This is done by reading the z-buffer as if it were a color image, the format of which is specified by the selected
 * vis type:
 *  - VIS_ZBUF_TYPE_IA   : Produces a monotonic fade from primColor to envColor as depth increases.
 *  - VIS_ZBUF_TYPE_RGBA : Produces vibrant almost-periodic-looking bands.
 *
 * In both cases this occurs because of the format the depth information takes: it is 18-bit, and is a nonnegative
 * floating-point number with
 *     bbb      mmmmmmmmmmm dd|dd
 *     exponent mantissa    dz value (only first 16 bits visible to CPU, the least significant 2 bits of dz are ignored)
 *
 * Reading z-buffer as IA16:
 *     bbbmmmmm mmmmmmdd
 *     iiiiiiii aaaaaaaa
 *
 * Since floating-point numbers of this format have the same ordering as their binary/hex representation, increasing
 * the depth also increases the intensity in the IA16 representation and hence the interpolation parameter used to
 * combine primColor and envColor. The alpha is ignored by the RenderMode.
 *
 * Reading z-buffer as RGBA16:
 *     bbbmm mmmmm mmmmd d
 *     rrrrr ggggg bbbbb a
 *
 * The red increases monotonically with the depth. The significant visible oscillation is the green component, because
 * it rolls over every time the second-most-significant bit of the mantissa increments. The blue component oscillates
 * too rapidly to be particularly visible (it rolls over when the 7th-most-significant bit increments). The alpha is
 * again ignored by the RenderMode.
