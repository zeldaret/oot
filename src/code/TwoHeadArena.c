/**
 * @file TwoHeadArena.c
 *
 * This file implements a simple general purpose double-ended stack allocator.
 *
 * A double-ended stack allocator accepts allocations at either the "head" or "tail" of its allotted memory region.
 * While in general this type of allocator could accept deallocations on the most recently allocated block at either
 * end, this implementation does not support any individual deallocations; the only provided way to deallocate anything
 * is to reset the entire arena, deallocating everything. This scheme is most applicable to allocating similar data
 * with identical lifetime.
