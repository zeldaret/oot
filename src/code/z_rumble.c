 * @file z_rumble.c

 * This file implements an interface for the game state to set up, manage and request use of the rumble pak. Despite

 * to rumble.
 * This file is half of the system that runs on the graph thread alongside the game state. The rest of the system that
 * processes the requests runs on the padmgr thread and is implemented in `sys_rumble.c`.
 *
 * @see sys_rumble.c
 *
 * @note Original filename is likely z_vibrate.c or similar as it is ordered after z_ss_sram.c and before z_view.c

 * Submits a request to the rumble manager with the properties given in the arguments. If there is no free request slot

 *
 * @param distSq
 *     Squared distance, usually taken to be from an apparent source to the player in world coordinates.
 * @param sourceStrength
 *     The strength of the rumble at 0 distance from the source.
 *     The rumble source strength decreases linearly with distance, a distance of 0 results in the full source strength
 *     while a distance of 1000 or greater is discarded. A source strength of 0 is discarded. A minimum source strength
 *     of 1 drops to 0 at 3 units of distance from the source. A maximum source strength of 255 drops to 0 at 1000
 *     units of distance from the source.
 *     Note that, once the request has been submitted, if the distance to the source changes in subsequent frames while
 *     the rumble request is still running, the request will not be updated with the new distance.
 * @param duration
 *     The duration for which the rumble will sustain full strength. It is measured in Vertical Retraces rather than
 *     game frames. There are ~60 Retraces/s on NTSC and 50 Retraces/s on PAL.
 * @param decreaseRate
 *     The amount by which to lower the strength every Vertical Retrace once duration has hit 0.
