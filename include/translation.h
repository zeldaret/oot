 * The "T" macro holds translations in English for original debug strings written in Japanese.
 * The translated strings are only direct translations. Certain names or terms may not reflect

 * To use translated English strings in the build, change the definition below to "en".

 * Note: This translation macro exists for quality of life purposes.
 *       The original game would not have had a macro like this.
