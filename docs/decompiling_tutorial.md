This repository used to contain a tutorial for how to do
decompilation work in the repo.

It has been less useful as more and more was decompiled,
and also more of a chore to keep up-to-date, so it has been
removed from the repo.

It is still interesting for historical purposes or for
curiosity, you can find the last version of it in revision
[9963e7f5d5fa8caee329f6b40e393d8a2c45390b](https://github.com/zeldaret/oot/blob/9963e7f5d5fa8caee329f6b40e393d8a2c45390b/docs/tutorial/contents.md).
